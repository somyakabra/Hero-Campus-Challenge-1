Problem Statement:  
AI based connected solution for Vehicle & Driver Profiling 
Most of our 2 wheelers have TCUs (Telemetry Control Units) on them to collect 
vehicle specific data. The data to & from the TCU has to be streamed to a 
Connected Cloud Platorm. Once the data is available, with the help of AI the 
vehicle and driver profile has to be established which can help in determining 
vehicle health, driver behaviour etc which can then feed into Insurance & 
Warranty.
